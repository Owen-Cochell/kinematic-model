"""
This file contains components for developing processors,
and some default built-in processors.

A 'processor' is a callable that takes a single container as input,
and returns a resulting container.
Processors *must* return a container, even if processing is done in place.
A processor can be a simple function, or a class that provides a callable interface.
For complex processors that must maintain state, it is recommended to use the 'BaseProcessor'
class, defined below.
Processors can do many things, including but not limited to:

 - Altering the data in the container in some way
 - Converting to a new container type
 - Logging container information for debugging

    A base class for processors.

    A 'processor' is a callable object that takes in a container

    Once processing is done, then the processor *must* return a container,

    Processors are not required to utilize this class or be classes,
    but for processors that must maintain state, it is recommended to use this class.

    This class implements a callable interface for processors,
    allowing them to be utilized in pipelines.
    For implementing your own functionality, it is recommended to
    override the 'process' method, which will be called when processing is necessary.
